## Our Research Focus

Consciousness is central to human life, allowing people to experience and respond to the world. Our laboratory investigates brain mechanisms of normal consciousness and when consciousness is impaired by epileptic seizures. We use powerful brain imaging techniques, electrical measurements and testing of behavior. By understanding the mechanisms of consciousness, we hope to restore normal consciousness to patients with epilepsy and other brain disorders.
Our work investigates brain networks including the cerebral cortex interacting with deeper structures such as the thalamus and brainstem. We use single cell and larger-scale electrical recordings, multi-modal neuroimaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neurotransmitter measurements and other techniques. Our goal is to rapidly translate findings from the research lab to practical applicationsâ€”greatly improving quality of life.
